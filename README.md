# Why does this repo exist?
This  is just a small project to learn the ropes of the Julia programming language (more info can be found on the official site https://julialang.org/), using Project Euler (https://projecteuler.net/).
# What is Project Euler?
Project Euler is a series of mathematical problems aimed to be solved with computational aid.
# Who are you?
I am Quinto Edoardo, a computer science student. This is a project to better learn programming and math in a fun way :). The solution here won't probably always be the best complexity wise, but they are my solution!
